# 🧠 Unity Image Changer (Fitts' Law-Based VR Research)

This project was developed as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research study under the supervision of **Marium-E-Jannat** at the University of British Columbia. It explores the application of **Fitts' Law** in immersive VR environments, focusing on user-target interaction and motion analysis.
